This project integrates key learning outcomes from the course, such as hardware interfacing, control algorithm development, and serial communication between the microcontroller and a PC. By adjusting control parameters like controller gains (Kp and Ki) and sampling time in real-time, we observed the system's performance changes. We generated a reference velocity using a potentiometer, and the PI control algorithm minimized the error between the reference and actual velocity. This project not only tested our technical skills but also deepened our understanding of control system dynamics.
